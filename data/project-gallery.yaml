It will also go beyond basic information access, connecting people with individuals and organizations that can help them ¨translate” the complex jargon of environmental information and link them to others interested in environmental advocacy and action related to the information they seek. Through environmental information access and online connection opportunities, Green Archives will connect localized communities with wider networks that may help facilitate legislative, judicial, or regulatory community work to face the environmental issue at hand."

  description:  "Sparked by a conversation at the Department of Justice Canada’s 2014 Policy Bazaar, the Policy Sector recently launched the Indigenous Policy and Program Innovation (IPPI) Hub, an 18-month pilot that will explore how new policy techniques, such as design thinking, can be used to address the over-representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. Similar to other labs in the federal government, the IPPI Hub brings together various stakeholders to collect and share information, test new approaches, conduct analysis and co-create options and solutions directly with the users or citizens affected by a policy issue. In addition to applying innovative approaches to Indigenous justice-related policy and program development, the Hub’s mandate also includes raising awareness of new policy development techniques. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub envisions Justice Canada as a department where officials at all levels, regardless of their job title, are equipped with the knowledge to use innovative tools in all areas of their work (where possible)."

  description:  "Budgeting and expenditure data is the quantitative expression of a government’s priorities. Making it available to the public imposes hard challenges that not every administration is ready to undertake. The lack of IT capabilities and constrained resources of government agencies make it difficult for them to respond to the demands of information from their constituencies, transparency advocates, the press and central governments. Moreover, these administrations don’t usually have access to analysis tools that help them view how the resources are being used and to detect potential risks of misspending. SpendView is a platform for analysis and visualization of government budget, expenditure and revenue data."
