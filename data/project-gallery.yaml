Similar to other labs in the federal government, the IPPI Hub brings together various stakeholders to collect and share information, test new approaches, conduct analysis and co-create options and solutions directly with the users or citizens affected by a policy issue. In addition to applying innovative approaches to Indigenous justice-related policy and program development, the Hub’s mandate also includes raising awareness of new policy development techniques. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub envisions Justice Canada as a department where officials at all levels, regardless of their job title, are equipped with the knowledge to use innovative tools in all areas of their work (where possible)."

  background: "In 2010, Manuel Aristaran launched Gasto Publico Bahiense (gastopublicobahiense.org), a site that made it easier to visualize the checkbook entries published by the government of Bahia Blanca, Argentina. That impact of the initiative led to a collaboration with the government, that resulted in the sponsorship of SpendView."
  description: "Budgeting and expenditure data is the quantitative expression of a government’s priorities. Making it available to the public imposes hard challenges that not every administration is ready to undertake. The lack of IT capabilities and constrained resources of government agencies make it difficult for them to respond to the demands of information from their constituencies, transparency advocates, the press and central governments. Moreover, these administrations don’t usually have access to analysis tools that help them view how the resources are being used and to detect potential risks of misspending. SpendView is a platform for analysis and visualization of government budget, expenditure and revenue data."
  impact: "We are currently working with other municipal, provincial and federal in Latin America, helping them to adopt SpendView for internal use, or as a tool for fiscal transparency. Using open data, we built instances of Presupuesto Abierto/Spend View for the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina (http://caba.presupuestoabierto.org) and Montevideo, Uruguay (http://montevideo.presupuestoabierto.org)"

  tagline: "Turning Grassroots Activism into Participatory, Accountable Governance"
  description:  "Since 2008, Europe has faced its deepest economic and political crisis since Second World War. In this context, new social movements and political parties are emerging, particularly in Southern European democracies. Podemos, a new Spanish political party born from grassroots activism and protests (Indignados Movement), is trying to reinvigorate public institutions that have lost the trust of the public introducing massive online direct democracy participation mechanisms where Spanish citizens can make proposals, ask questions of Podemos leaders, and even propose projects for which to use party money. Taking into account that the citizen’s response to this political initiative is being overwhelming, our project studies the unique tools Podemos has implemented to analyze the potential, and potential pitfalls, of more direct and participatory democracy. Using Podemos as a case study, the project is theoretically and socially relevant because it aims to analyze a unique contemporary experience of direct democracy and recommend &quot;best practices&quot; to other parties around the world, and across the political spectrum, that wish to experiment with and implement direct democratic participation through democracy. The project will discuss the successes and problems Podemos has faced in rolling out these tools, and recommendations for their use going forward in terms of how new technologies can better serve to democratic regeneration."

  sectors: not-for-profit # not-for-profit || public-sector || academia || entrepreneur
  location: "Global online audience. Based in New York, NY, U.S."
  tagline: "Mapping and crowdsourcing the universe of public policy solutions."
  background: "New public policy is made every day by local, national and international government institutions. Although governments operate in different contexts across the world, they nonetheless face very similar governance challenges--for example, educating their populations or increasing their public’s safety. Due to this significant overlap in governmental missions, tremendous potential exists for societies to pool together their collective knowledge and learn from each other’s successes and failures."
  description:  "PolicyAtlas is a growing, non-­partisan project to develop a user-contributed encyclopedia of known public policy solutions (the “Atlas”). The Atlas will cover all major policy fields such as education, environmental, health, and transportation policy. For example, when a local government official seeks to reduce pedestrian deaths from automobile accidents, they can search the Atlas for policies that aim to achieve this goal and be presented with options such as traffic calming devices, pedestrian bridges and complete street designations. Dedicated articles cover each featured policy concept with a summary of its goals, implementation considerations, research studies, and supporters and opponents. Ultimately, the goal of PolicyAtlas is to improve the quality of public policymaking--and the lives of all who are governed--by providing more public policy options, informing better choices among public policies, and improving the design of policies in order to increase their likely political viability and effectiveness."
  impact: "Ultimately, the goal of PolicyAtlas is to improve the quality of public policymaking--and the lives of all who are governed--by providing more public policy options, informing better choices among public policies, and improving the design of policies in order to increase their likely political viability and effectiveness. PolicyAtlas is to become the most useful public policy resource in the world. Specific types of people who should find the Atlas useful include government officials, election candidates, journalists, advocates and researchers."

People will be able to use a mobile app to ‘catch them doing something good’ - such as recycling, or saving energy. This way, we’ll create a large crowd-sourced database of responsible companies. We’ll start by targeting small towns in concerted campaigns to create competition between companies. This way we’ll quickly reach tipping points where they begin to ‘race to the top’. Business will realise that to be successful, they need to contribute positively to the environment and community."
