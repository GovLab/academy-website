		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p><p>Today we have a misalignment between our citizens’ expectations that government will solve problems effectively and fast and how public procurement is practiced. Government should not be spending as much to make a website as it invests in scientific research to map the human brain. Contracts should not get awarded to the same enterprise over and over again but attract more and more diverse competitors.</p>
<p>But bringing innovation to the government supply chain is also about meeting the needs of citizens more effectively by accepting that in government we should excel of defining the problems and allow the market to inspire us about the different approaches to solving them. This can also be about data-informed decision support, new evaluation frameworks and more representative selection panels.</p>
<p>Ideal participants are those who have already identified a project and/or have a project underway and have clear insight into the problem they are trying to address. This course is designed for those focusing on all stages and types of contracting reform, bureaucracy and problem-solving at all levels of government, including projects that: make procurement better at solving problems; lower the entry barrier to participation; attract more diverse, minority and women-owned businesses; enable more open review and decision-making processes; encourage the procurement of innovative solutions; decrease corruption and improve accountability. If you are engaged in an effort to bring greater sanity to the procurement process come join us!</p> 
<p>The GovLab Academy coaching programs have helped 450 government, social and civic entrepreneurs take 250 projects from idea to implementation.  We aim to help you “cross the chasm” from idea to implementation and help you scale.</p>
