              <h4>Chairman of the Department of Better Technology</h4>
              <p>Clay Johnson is an American technologist, co-founder and Chairman of the Department of Better Technology and best known for his role in supporting political campaigns and government agencies with technology services. He was one of the founders of Blue State Digital, the firm that built and managed Barack Obama’s online campaign for the presidency in 2008. After leaving Blue State, Johnson was the director of Sunlight Labs at the Sunlight Foundation, where he built an army of 2000 developers and designers to build open source tools to give people greater access to government data. He was awarded the Google/O’Reilly Open Source Organizer of the year in 2009, was one of Federal Computing Week’s Fed 100 in 2010, and won the CampaignTech Innovator award in 2011. Johnson’s combination of experience as a developer, working in politics, entrepreneurism, and non-profit work gives him a unique perspective on media and culture. His life is dedicated to giving people greater access to the truth about what’s going on in their communities, their cities and their governments. He still claims that he learned all he needs to know from a two year tour as the late-shift waiter at Waffle House in Atlanta, GA.</p>

              <h4>Coordinator of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre</h4>
              <p>Francois Grey is a physicist by training, with a background in nanotechnology and a passion for citizen science. Since September 2014, he is Invited Professor at the University of Geneva and Manager of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a partnership between CERN, the United Nations Institute of Training and Research and the University of Geneva. 
<br/>
The CCC develops technologies that lower the barrier to entry for online participatory science and promotes the use of these technologies in developing regions through face-to-face meetups between scientists, developers and citizens. The CCC has helped to launch citizen science projects such as CERN’s Test4Theory, which is part of the LHC@home volunteer computing initiative, and open source platforms for citizen science like Crowdcrafting.org, for volunteer thinking. Events launched by the CCC include the Africa@Home, Asia@home and Brasil@home workshops series, the CERN Webfest and the biannual Citizen Cyberscience Summit. 
<br/>
From 2013-2014 Francois was Head of Citizen Science at NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress, where he launched the Science and the City hackathons in collaboration with ITP, NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program and Science Hack Day NYC in collaboration with the World Science Festival. 
<br/>
Francois was based in Beijing from 2008-2013, where he helped establish the Open Wisdom Lab at Tsinghua University, China’s MIT, to promote concepts of open and participatory science. He also helped establish Tsinghua’s Lifelong Learning Lab, which extends concepts of participatory science to children of all ages. He has also been a visiting Senior International Expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he initiated online citizen science in China through a project called CAS@home. Francois received a prestigious Fellowship from the South-Africa-based Shuttleworth Foundation in 2010-11, for his efforts to promote citizen science in the developing world.

              <h4>Co-founder & Director of Community Development at the Public Lab</h4>
              <p>Liz is an activist and designer interested in collaborative urban environments. My early days in New York involved catalyzing public interactions on sidewalks and subway stations with a giant "Talk To Me" sign as well as working 25 floors above Wall Street (SOM) designing international new cities and campuses. I'm originally from North Carolina where I managed an urban agriculture youth enterprise called the Durham Inner-city Gardeners (DIG). Currently, when I'm not hoisting cameras up on balloons (with Public Laboratory) or hugging trees with tape measures (with TreeKIT), I teach geospatial tools for urban design at Columbia, Parsons, and Pratt.

        <h2 class="e-faq-trigger">FAQs</h2>
        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">What is an Academy Coaching Program?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Coaching programs are designed to help you take a project from idea to implementation and to scale. It is a hands-on, learning and mentoring program to help you design and implement solutions to a public interest problem using civic technology. Unlike a traditional accelerator, we focus only on the public interest and only on projects that work with real-world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">What is the goal of the GovLab Academy?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">The goal of the GovLab Academy is to train public problem solvers – what we call public entrepreneurs – to use technology to create implementable engagement projects with the ultimate objective of improving people’s lives. We do not measure success by levels of enrollment but by the impact participant projects create.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How Does it Work?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">The coaching programs are limited enrollment (maximum class size of 12 projects), entirely online, highly customized, and meet every week for 5 consecutive weeks or every other week for 10 weeks. To help you and your team become more effective, we offer a combination of coaching and skill-building, connection to a network of subject-matter experts, peer-to-peer mentoring, customized and original learning materials, and frequent and constructive feedback opportunities from a team of teachers and peers at every stage of your agile design-driven process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Where Do the Sessions Meet?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Entirely online.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How Much Time Will This Take?</p>
          <ul class="e-answer">
            <p>The coaching programs meet every week for 5 consecutive weeks or every other week for 10 weeks. The full group meets online with the faculty for 1-2 hours where one hour is discussion of projects by the group and the second hour is a guest lecture. On the alternate weeks of a ten week program, participants meet peer to peer for mutual support or with coaches and mentors for individualized consultations to address project progress. A five week course will have full group sessions as well as office hours and peer to peer support occurring during the same weeks as full group meetings.</p>
            <p>In addition, work will also take place through online channels such as email and discussion forums. Upon admission, faculty and staff will engage with your team to identify opportunities, diagnose problems, review resources and begin to establish a mentor network that may be useful for your specific project and you will be expected to come prepared for the first session.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Who May Apply?*</p>
          <div class="e-answer">
            <p>Public entrepreneurs working inside, outside, or in collaboration with public institutions. We will give strong preference to team, as opposed to individual, applications and we welcome submissions from the public, private and civil society sectors.</p>
            <p>No formal technology training is assumed or required, but an interest in using technology to solve public problems is key.</p>
            <p>And you have:</p>
            <ul class="b-list">
              <li>A problem about which you are passionate</li>
              <li>An open mind to developing innovative approaches that take advantage of technology to bring the broader palette of human expertise to bear on your problem</li>
              <li>Intellectual curiosity and a willingness to experiment and play with new tools</li>
              <li>Time and energy to commit to the program activities</li>
              <li>The drive to do what it takes to develop a project from idea to implementation with the potential of real-world impact for people and communities -- keeping in mind that the way to have the greatest impact might not involve building an app or creating a new non-profit, but collaborating with others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>* Further pre-requisites may apply on specific courses</p>

        </div>

         <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">What types of projects do participants work on?</p>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Who will lead each program?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Each coaching program will be led by a domain expert relevant to the course topic with the active support of the GovLab Academy team. You can read about the exceptional background and expertise of our Faculty <a href="http://govlabacademy.org/about.html#team-cards">here</a>. Coaches are supported by Teaching Assistants as well as additional mentors and experts.</p>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Do I Get Course Credit?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Those who successfully complete the program requirements will receive an authenticated badge and certificate from the GovLab.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How long is the program?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">The length of each program is every week for 5 consecutive weeks or every other week for 10 weeks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Do I Have to Pay Something?</p>
          <div class="e-answer">
            <p>Free coaching programs are supported by philanthropic support that enable us to offer the program at no cost to you. Where there is a fee indicated, that cost is per project (team or individual). Once you have been accepted into the program (approximately 3-5 business days after the application deadline), you will receive a tuition invoice from the GovLab Academy Team. The tuition should be paid in full prior to the start of the program through Paypal. Some scholarships may be available and we invite you to <a href="mailto:info-academy@thegovlab.org">email us</a> if you or your team cannot afford the cost.</p> 
            <p>For additional questions about tuition payment, please <a href="mailto:info-academy@thegovlab.org">contact us</a>.</p>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Who are the Mentors? Can I Pick My Own?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Mentors are either subject matter experts working on similar problems or challenges or people who have a track record as effective change agents. You can find your own, but we commit to helping to pair you with relevant domain experts. The best mentors, of course, are your classmates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">This Looks Like a Lot of Work?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">It is. This is not a simulation but an opportunity to get a real project closer to implementation. A lot of work will need to get done outside the classroom, such as user interviews and background research. In most cases, people are working on projects relevant to their work or to their passions and the commitment is worth it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Will I receive a certificate upon completion of the program?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">We will provide a Certificate of Accomplishment through Basno.com for individuals who complete all requirements of each program.  Certificates are authenticated and escrowed.</p>
